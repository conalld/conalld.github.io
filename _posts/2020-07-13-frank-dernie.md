A great interview with Frank Dernie who pioneered the use of computers for design in Formula One and layed the foundation for the data driven methods used in the sport today. A key takeaway for me is how, despite having invented these methods he is not completely convinced by them so to speak and in order to make a truly great race car engineers need to get underneath the car if needs be and physically see how a component is performing.
